# Assets

`carrot.png` : icon designating a tile with a reward. Contrast on the greenery was increased from the original.

`dollar-bag1.png` / `dollar-bag2.png` : iterations of an icon designating a tile with a win condition. The second one has the colors of the bag changed to be more of a lighter brown.

`gopher50x50.png` : originally started as egonelbre's `hiking.svg` gopher. I removed the backpack and the ground from it to make this icon.

`rock.png` : icon designating a tile with an obstacle.

`Screenshot1.png` : very early screenshot of the game.

`Screenshot2.png` : most recent screenshot of the game. At the time I took this screenshot, logic for the different objects was virtually non-existent; the gopher could walk right through them and nothing would happen.
