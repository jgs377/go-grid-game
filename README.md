# Grid Game

The initial aim of Grid Game is to learn to use the programming language Go. Beyond that, I am looking to produce something similar to OpenAI's [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) (known as [Gymnamsium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) today) - and this Grid Game is my way of starting small with a very simple environment (Gopher on a grid, achieving some objective).
