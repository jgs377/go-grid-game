# Grid Game

The initial aim of Grid Game is to learn to use the programming language Go. Beyond that, I am looking to produce an environment for reinforcement learning algorithms written in Go to play some simple games. This project is inspired by OpenAI's [Gym](https://github.com/openai/gym) (known as [Gymnamsium](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) today) which is written in python. This Grid Game is my way of starting small with a very simple environment (Gopher on a grid, achieving some objective). One objective I have, is that a human should be able to play the game with a GUI.
